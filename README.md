# Flight Data Management System

Welcome to our Flight Data Management System!

With the code in this repository, you can simulate the workflow of a client sending information to a central server which stores telemetry data to a SQL Database. Designed in Windows Visual Studio we now have a solution for reading telemetry logs real-time.

There are several other pieces of documentation in regards to requirements but these can be found on the requirements document that is supplied with our associated party.

# Branches
Branches are associated with large sub-sections of requirements, associated with our User Stories in which encompasses several requirements and issues to be handled. This is then divided to our team members to handle their sections and if there is a problem with communication between branches a discussion would be brought up within our  weekly sprint planning or an emergency stand up meeting if there were to be a huge issue. If the project scope were to be bigger, we may need to consider using a Kanban in regards to development with our branches.
