This project contains tests for the FdmsDatabase class.
The class needs an sql database to communicate with, so the UnitTest project creates a local database and deploys the FDMS schema to it.
The SQLLocalDB program is needed in order to run a local database. The SQLLocalDB program is included with installations of Microsoft SQL Server.
